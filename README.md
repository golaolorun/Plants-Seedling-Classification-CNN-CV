# Plants-Seedling-Classification-CNN-CV
Data Science project using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- by: _Gbenga Olaolorun_

## Description
This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify plant seedlings into 12 distinct species based on image data. The model will streamline the process of identifying and sorting different plant species, reducing the time and effort required in agricultural practices.

## Background and Context
The agriculture industry faces a pressing need for modernization to reduce the extensive manual labor required to monitor plant growth and identify different species. Despite advancements in agricultural technology, the ability to sort and recognize plants and weeds remains a time-consuming task for workers in the field.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a significant opportunity to revolutionize this trillion-dollar industry by minimizing manual labor and enhancing efficiency in identifying plant seedlings. The implementation of AI and Deep Learning can lead to better crop yields, allowing human workers to focus on higher-order agricultural decision-making, ultimately contributing to more sustainable practices in agriculture.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of images of unique plants belonging to 12 distinct species, provided by the Aarhus University Signal Processing group in collaboration with the University of Southern Denmark. The dataset includes:

-  images.npy: A file containing the images of the plant seedlings converted to numpy arrays.
-  Labels.csv: A file containing the corresponding labels for each image, indicating the species.
Due to the large volume of data, the images are stored in images.npy, and the labels are provided in Labels.csv for seamless project execution without the overhead of handling large image files directly.

### List of Plant Species
-  Black-grass
-  Charlock
-  Cleavers
-  Common Chickweed
-  Common Wheat
-  Fat Hen
-  Loose Silky-bent
-  Maize
-  Scentless Mayweed
-  Shepherd's Purse
-  Small-flowered Cranesbill
-  Sugar Beet

## Objective
-  Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify plant seedlings into 12 different species.
-  Improve efficiency in plant species identification compared to manual sorting.

## Results
- The model's accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics will be displayed after training.

## Acknowledgements
- My Great Learning for providing the dataset and the problem statement.
